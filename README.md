# Addison-Group-Task 
## By Claire de Saint Phalle and Natalia Muromcew 

This aassignment was to do an exploratory data analysis of the csv and xls files provided by the Addison Gallery of American Art to find a question, answer it, and make a physical/visual representation of that answer. Claire and I questioned the distribution among medium types in the Addison collection.

This chart was made using the csv file from the Addison data, link to the Jupyter notebook used to code this [here](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/Addison-Group-Task/blob/main/Addison%20Data.ipynb).

This is a chart of our data and calculations used to make our final product. We listed the type, amount, percentage, the calulation used to make a scaled visual repesentation, and the dimensions per medium on the project. We divided all of the calculations by 6 to scale it.

We used collages of photos from the Addison arranged in squares representative of the percentage each medium. We found it surprising how many photographs and printes there were becuase those two categories made up about 65% of the collection.
